My random topic for this practice lab is my favorite dog breeds!

## Samoyed

I have this dog breed, and from my personal experience, they are very sociable, love people, and have a ***big*** personality. They originated from Siberia and were bred to be working dogs. They are medium to large in build and have a thick, long white coat.

#### Life expectancy 
12-15 years

## Chow Chow

I was about to get this dog breed before getting my Samoyed. Chow Chow originated from Northern China and they were bred for hunting and guarding. They also have a medium to large build with a thick brownish coat.

#### Life expectancy 
9-15 years

## Golden Retriever

This dog breed is another favorite of mine because they seem so ***family-friendly***. My neighbor has one, and they get along so well with other people and dogs. 

#### Life expectancy 
10-12 years
