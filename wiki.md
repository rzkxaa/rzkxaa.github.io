My random topic will be about my favorite dog breeds!

## Samoyed

I have this dog breed and from my personal experience, they are very sociable, loves people, and have a **big** personality. They originated from Siberia and were bred to be a working dog. They have medium to large built with a thick long white coat.

## Chow Chow

I was about to get this dog breed before getting my Samoyed. Chow Chow origanted from Northern China and they were bred for hunting and guarding. They also have a medium to large built with a thick brownish coat.

## Golden Retriever

This dog breed is another favorite of mine because they just seem so family **friendly**. My neighbor has this dog and they get along so well with other people and other dogs.
